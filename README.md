# star-rating
- Pain : Sometimes, I had a very bad experience in a restaurant, an app, a product or whatever and to review, I can rate 1 to 5 stars but I cannot rate to 0 star.
- Dream : I can rating with 0 star.
- Fix : This is a module with stars to rate 0 to 5. 0 : represent by a black star and 1 to 5 by yellow stars.
